            <p>I am Shehu Muhammad. I am from New Haven, CT. In college, I took a computer science class that most students used in place of a math 
                class. The class was on building websites using HTML and CSS. This class got me interested in web development. After graduating from
                Central Connecticut State University, I begin to watch youtube videos and take Udemy courses to further increase my web development 
                skills. 
            </p>
            <p>Shehu is a web developer that specializes in Frontend Responsive Design.</p>
